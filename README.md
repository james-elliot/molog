# MOLOG, a PROLOG for modal logic

MOLOG was written and published in 1992, at the dawn of languages based on PROLOG. It was designed to implement PROLOG resolution mechanisms on other logics than predicate logic. In fact it can be used to implement any kind of logic using Gentzen sequents. My PhD supervisor was Luis Fari√±as who had worked at Marseilles/Luminy with Alain Colmerauer (the father of PROLOG).  
Unfortunately, the second AI winter of the 90s killed almost all research on these subjects; moreover, today, non classical logics use technics such as tableaux to solve the same kind of problems.

MOLOG was written in ADA, and was parallel on a ethernet network of Sun workstations, with a master/slave model. Part of it was written in C for the implementation of non blocking communications between master and slaves. Let's remind the reader that in 1992 multi-core machines were virtually unknown and the ADA ALSYS compiler did not properly implement communications on Sun/Unix machines : if one task was waiting for an input, all tasks were stopped, as all tasks were implemented inside the same process, with no threads.  So I had to develop my own set of routines for non blocking communications to implement network parallelism (it was called PARADISE).

At the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of PROLOG (and the thirtieth of MOLOG), I decided to dig out the old code. The ADA part compiled and worked almost on the spot, the C implementation of communications was a mess. The perfect solution would be to rewrite this part using MPI/ADA bindings, but this kind of beast seems hard to find, and it is extremely dubious that I will ever work again on this code.

So I publish this version, which is full ADA, but doesn't implement any parallelism. It's a kind of tribute to all people who ever worked on these subjects, and whose work has slowly sunk into oblivion. 

You need gnu make and the gnat ada compiler:  
Compile by typing: make  
Run the example with:  
  ./master < examples/chevalier

The example is known as *The King's Wise Men Hat Puzzle*. It is a classical induction puzzle and is described in a wikipedia page
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_puzzles#The_King's_Wise_Men_Hat_Puzzle). 

There is a short description of MOLOG in this [paper](http://www.alliot.fr/papers/fgcs92.pdf), presented at the last Fifth Generation Computer System Conference in 1992 (FGCS'92).
There is also a wikipedia page for MOLOG, but in french. The detailed coding of the wise men hat puzzle is described
[inside](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOLOG).
For more information you can read my [PhD](http://www.alliot.fr/papers/thesejma.pdf), but it is in french also...
